Hi, I'm Dennis.

This pagely is mainly created to bundle some projects I've been working on, and to make it easier to show them to other people. I can use it for blog posts and as a resume also.

For a few of my creations I would like to direct you to the [Projects page], or to my public repositories at [Github](https://github.com/dzet). 

I can be contacted through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denniszethof).
